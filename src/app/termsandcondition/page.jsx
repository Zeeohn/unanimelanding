              Provision of the Services

            You acknowledge that Bold&apos;s Services may be accessed through various
            branded platforms or apps, each designed for specific transportation
            or logistics needs. Bold works with third-party providers, including
            fleet operators and independent contractors, who fulfill requests
            made through the platform. <br /> <br />
            These services may be provided under various sub-brands or features
            associated with transportation (e.g., Bold Ride, Bold Logistics),
            and certain services may be subject to additional terms or
            conditions. <br /> <br />
            <span className="font-bold">Third-Party Services and Content</span>

            The Services may include content or services from third parties that
            are not under Bold’s control. Bold does not endorse these services
            and is not responsible for any issues arising from them. If you use
            third-party services or content, additional terms and privacy
            policies may apply. <br /> <br />
            Additionally, if you access the Bold app on devices such as iOS or

            <br />
            Bold may offer rides through autonomous vehicles (AVs). AVs operate
            with automated driving systems and may be used to fulfill ride
            requests. If you prefer not to ride in an AV, you can select a
            non-AV ride option. <br />
            <br />
            Autonomous vehicle services may be provided by third-party operators
            or Bold’s affiliates, and additional terms may apply to these

            <br /> Bold may issue promotional codes (“Promo Codes”) that can be
            redeemed for credits, discounts, or other benefits. These Promo
            Codes are subject to specific terms and conditions, including:{" "}

            <br />
            Bold allows you to submit or upload content such as comments,
            feedback, and promotional entries (“User Content”). While you retain
            ownership of your User Content, by submitting it to Bold, you grant
            Bold a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual license to use, modify,
            and distribute it as part of the Services. You confirm that you
            either own or have permission to use any content you provide, and
            that it does not infringe on any third-party rights or laws. <br />
            <br />
            You agree not to submit any content that is unlawful, defamatory,
            obscene, or offensive as determined by Bold. Bold reserves the right
            to remove or modify User Content at its discretion, without notice.

            <span className="font-bold">Network Access and Devices</span> <br />
            <br />
            You are responsible for obtaining the necessary data network access
            to use the Services. Additional data or messaging charges may apply
            depending on your mobile provider. You are also responsible for
            ensuring your device meets the requirements to access and use the
            Services, and for keeping your device and the app up-to-date. Bold
            does not guarantee that the Services will be compatible with all
            devices, and the Services may experience interruptions due to
            network issues or other technical malfunctions.

          <p className="font-bold text-xl">4. Payment</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            By using Bold’s Services, you understand that charges may apply for
            the transportation and logistics services you receive from
            third-party providers (“Charges”). After receiving services or
            goods, Bold will facilitate payment of the applicable Charges on
            behalf of the third-party provider as their limited payment
            collection agent. Payment of these Charges will be considered the
            same as if you paid the third-party provider directly. Charges may
            include applicable taxes as required by law. All Charges are final
            and non-refundable unless otherwise determined by Bold. <br />
            <br />
            You have the right to request lower Charges from a third-party
            provider at the time you receive services or goods, and Bold will
            respond accordingly to any such requests. <br />
            <br />
            All Charges are due immediately, and payment will be processed by
            Bold using the preferred payment method linked to your Account.
            After payment is made, you will receive a receipt by email. If your
            primary payment method is expired, invalid, or otherwise unable to
            be charged, Bold may use any secondary payment method you’ve
            provided, if available. <br />
            <br />
            Bold reserves the right to establish, adjust, or remove Charges for
            any services or goods offered through the platform, at its
            discretion. You understand that Charges may increase during periods
            of high demand in certain areas. While Bold will attempt to inform
            you of such charges, you are responsible for all Charges incurred
            under your Account, regardless of whether you were aware of them or
            their amounts. <br />
            <br />
            From time to time, Bold may offer promotional discounts or special
            offers, which may affect the Charges applied to you. These
            promotions are only valid if they are made available to you and will
            not affect your Charges unless explicitly stated. <br />
            <br />
            If you decide to cancel your request for services or goods before
            the third-party provider arrives, you may be charged a cancellation
            fee. <br />
            <br />
            This payment structure is intended to compensate the third-party
            provider for the services or goods rendered. Unless specified
            otherwise, Bold does not designate any portion of your payment as a
            tip or gratuity to the third-party provider. Tips are voluntary, and
            while you are free to leave a gratuity, you are under no obligation
            to do so. <br />
            <br /> After receiving services, you will have the opportunity to
            rate your experience and leave feedback about the third-party
            provider. <br />

            <span className="font-bold">
              Repair or Cleaning Fees
            </span> <br /> <br />
            You are responsible for any costs related to the repair of damage or
            necessary cleaning of third-party provider vehicles or property due
            to use under your Account, beyond normal wear and tear. If a
            third-party provider reports the need for repair or cleaning, and
            this request is verified by Bold, we may facilitate payment of the
            reasonable costs for these repairs using the payment method linked
            to your Account. These amounts will be transferred directly to the
            third-party provider and are non-refundable.

          <br />
          <p>
            These Terms shall be governed exclusively by and construed under the
            laws of Portugal, excluding its conflict of laws provisions. The
            Vienna Convention on the International Sale of Goods of 1980 (CISG)
            shall not apply. Any dispute, conflict, claim, or controversy
            arising from or related to the Services or these Terms, including
            those concerning its validity, construction, or enforceability (a
            “Dispute”), must first be submitted to mediation under the
            International Chamber of Commerce Mediation Rules (“ICC Mediation
            Rules”). <br />
            <br />
            If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after a
            request for mediation has been submitted, it may be referred to
            arbitration and resolved exclusively through arbitration under the
            Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC
            Arbitration Rules”). The Emergency Arbitrator provisions of the ICC
            Rules are excluded. The Dispute shall be resolved by one (1)
            arbitrator appointed according to the ICC Rules. The place of both
            mediation and arbitration shall be Lisbon, Portugal, unless
            otherwise specified by applicable laws. <br />
            <br />
            The mediation and/or arbitration proceedings will be conducted in
            English, unless you do not speak English, in which case the
            proceedings will be conducted in both English and your native
            language. All details of the mediation and arbitration, including
            documents, correspondence, and any orders or awards, shall remain
            strictly confidential unless: (i) disclosure is necessary for
            conducting the proceedings; and (ii) the third party involved agrees
            to be bound by the confidentiality terms.

            You may not assign or transfer these Terms without Bold’s prior
            written consent. However, you agree that Bold may assign or transfer
            these Terms to: (i) a subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) a buyer of
            Bold’s equity, business, or assets; or (iii) a successor by merger.

            If any provision of these Terms is deemed illegal, invalid, or

            removed or modified to the extent necessary, without affecting the
            remaining provisions. The parties will replace the illegal, invalid,
            or unenforceable provision with a valid and enforceable one that
            closely reflects the original intent. These Terms represent the
            complete agreement between you and Bold and supersede all previous
            or contemporaneous agreements related to its subject matter. The
            terms “including” and “include” mean “including, but not limited
